# Python Problem Set # 0

# 1. Given a number between 1 and 100, check if it is prime or not.

A number is prime if it is divisible by only 1 and itself. 1 is not a prime.
Write a programme which takes a number input, and checks if it is prime or not.

## Input :
(1,56,17,"twenty nine")
Note the string input in the end.

#2. Using the ideas from first problem, write a programme which gives you first N primes

##Input : (5,10,100)

Notice the time taken to solve the problem increases as you increase N
What improvements can be made?

#3. Given the coordinates of a triangle, check if it is a right angle triangle or not. Also find it's area.

## Input : 
$$ (x_1, y_1), (x_2,y_2), (x_3,y_3) $$
