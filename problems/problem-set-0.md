# Python Problem Set # 0

# 1. Given a number between 1 and 100, check if it is prime or not.

A number is prime if it is divisible by only 1 and itself. 1 is not a prime.
Write a programme which takes a number input, and checks if it is prime or not.

## Input :
(1,56,17,"twenty nine")
Note the string input in the end.

#2. Using the ideas from first problem, write a programme which gives you first N primes.

##Input : (5,10,100)

Notice the time taken to solve the problem increases as you increase N
What improvements can be made?

#3. Given the coordinates of a triangle, check if it is a right angle triangle or not. Also find it's area.

## Input :
$$ (x_1, y_1), (x_2,y_2), (x_3,y_3) $$

#4. Reversals

 - Given a number, find and print its reverse

    for eg. 1345 -> 5431

    Note: Try not to use the internet for this, and figure out the 'algorithm' on your own.

 - Given a string, find and print its reverse

    for eg. ahoronov -> vonoroha

    Note: For this, maybe look up how, on the internet.

 - Now that you know the procedure for strings, do you think you can use it to reverse a number?

    Hint: You can convert between 'strings' and 'integers'.

#5. Re-ordering

Given a list of fruits:

    fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'mango', 'guava', 'orange', 'pineapple', 'strawberry']

write a program to re-order them in ascending order of your preference of these fruits.
